# MyLife RPG Product Roadmap
Last updated: February 15, 2026
Domain target: `myliferpg.app`

## 0) Living Document Rules (Mandatory For AI Agents And Contributors)
This file, `README.md`, and `AGENTS.md` are living documents.

Required on every shipped feature, behavior change, or roadmap reprioritization:
1. Update this file:
- Move items between `Implemented`, `In Progress`, and `Planned`.
- Update `Last updated` with the real date.
- Update `Immediate Execution Queue` to reflect current priorities.
2. Update `README.md`:
- Keep product capabilities, setup notes, and current feature list aligned with reality.
3. Update `AGENTS.md` when process/rules/conventions changed:
- Keep agent instructions aligned with current development workflow.
4. Never leave stale statuses:
- If a feature is shipped, mark it as implemented in this roadmap in the same task.

Status legend used in this document:
- `Implemented`: live in codebase and validated.
- `In Progress`: partially delivered or active branch effort.
- `Planned`: not started.

## 1) Product Vision
Build the most effective and most engaging RPG habit and bad-habit recovery platform by combining:
- Evidence-backed behavior change methods
- High-retention game loops
- Low-friction daily use
- Non-judgmental relapse recovery
- Strong social accountability

The ideal end state is a product that helps users:
- Build durable good habits
- Quit or reduce harmful habits
- Recover quickly after slips
- Stay engaged for months, not days

## 2) Product Principles
1. Recovery over perfection: slips are expected and handled with immediate recovery pathways.
2. Tiny actions win: optimize for "doable today" over perfect plans.
3. Clarity over complexity: each screen should answer "what should I do next?"
4. Visible progress every day: health, money, streak, stats, and story progression.
5. Social support without shame: accountability should encourage, not punish.
6. Personalization over generic nudges: interventions adapt by trigger patterns and engagement history.
7. Privacy and trust by default: clear controls, minimal data collection, transparent usage.

## 3) Current Implementation Status (Live)
Implemented:
- Daily check-ins (intention, if-then plan, craving intensity, triggers, reflection, slip flag)
- Bad-habit slip logging with recovery penalty/status effect
- Expanded quest fields (difficulty, due date, richer details)
- Dashboard metrics upgrades
- Improved dashboard and landing UX

In progress:
- None currently tracked

Planned (not yet implemented):
- Social accountability systems
- Adaptive coaching and guided programs
- Deep relapse-prevention workflows
- Passive tracking integrations (HealthKit/Google Fit/wearables)
- Smart notification orchestration
- Full analytics and experimentation framework
- Advanced RPG systems (party raids, seasons, economy, prestige)
- Trust/safety/compliance hardening for behavior-change at scale

2. Risk: Shame loops after relapse.
- Mitigation: neutral language, instant recovery actions, no punitive walls.

3. Risk: Notification fatigue.
- Mitigation: adaptive frequency and preference controls.

4. Risk: Social toxicity in groups.
- Mitigation: strict moderation tooling and defaults to private groups.

5. Risk: AI trust issues.
- Mitigation: constrained domains, confidence signaling, escalation rules.

## 19) Definition of "Ideal v1.0" (Target Product Bar)
The app qualifies as "ideal v1.0" when:
1. Users can run full daily planning, execution, and reflection without leaving the app.
2. Every slip has a clear and immediate recovery path.
3. Craving moments trigger useful interventions within seconds.
4. Users can choose solo, buddy, or party accountability.
5. Progress is visible across behavior, health proxies, money saved, and RPG growth.
6. Retention and behavior outcomes improve meaningfully versus baseline.

## 20) Immediate Execution Queue (Next 2 Sprints)
Sprint 1:
1. `craving_events` + logging UI + trigger tags.
2. Rescue toolkit MVP (timer, breathing, substitution action).
3. Recovery plan wizard after slip.
4. Money saved model + dashboard card.
5. Event taxonomy instrumentation foundation.

Sprint 2:
1. 42-day challenge engine skeleton.
2. Buddy system MVP (pairing + check-ins).
3. Weekly digest with trend summary.
4. Smart reminder scheduler baseline.
5. Cohort dashboard for retention and slip recovery.

## 21) Ongoing Maintenance Checklist
Run this checklist whenever development changes product behavior:

1. Update status in `## 3) Current Implementation Status (Live)`.
2. Move completed backlog items out of planned sections (or annotate as implemented where relevant).
3. Reorder and refresh `## 20) Immediate Execution Queue (Next 2 Sprints)`.
4. Update `Last updated` date at the top of this file.
5. Update `README.md` feature descriptions and any setup/deployment notes affected.
6. Update `AGENTS.md` only if agent workflow/rules/conventions changed.
7. If dates or priorities changed, use concrete dates and remove ambiguous timing.
